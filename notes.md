## Preprocessing



What kind of interesting and informative networks can be created by filtering or selection?:

### A network with many connected nodes = many genes.
maybe have a cutoff filtering? Like less than 3 connections is not strong enought?

### Networks where the sum of the edges is high = many co-mentioning articles.

### High edge-sum/nodes = high importance of the network, many articles.
Some nodes in the graph do not have any connecting edges = virgin territory or maybe uninteresting.
Networks that consists of only few nodes where the connecting edges have low weights = not much research has been made.
Networks that connect to a specific gene = an overview of a interaction network, maybe a biological process.
Networks that has a specific gene as a center and has connections to the n'th degree (star shaped).
